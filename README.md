# Beta-Variational-Autoencoder (Beta-VAE)

This project implements a Beta Variational Autoencoder (Beta-VAE) for generating synthetic data from structured datasets. By introducing a beta coefficient to the standard VAE framework, the model encourages disentangled latent representations, improving control and interpretability in data generation.
