# Beta-Variational-Autoencoder (Beta-VAE)

This project implements a Beta Variational Autoencoder (Beta-VAE) for generating synthetic data from structured datasets. By introducing a beta coefficient to the standard VAE framework, the model encourages disentangled latent representations, improving control and interpretability in data generation.

## 📂 Project Structure

- `main_VAE.ipynb`: Core notebook containing model architecture, training, and evaluation.
- `1390_train_data.xlsx`: Sample training dataset.
- `main_dataset_.xlsx`: Main dataset used for experiments.
- `requirements.txt`: Python dependencies for running the notebook.
